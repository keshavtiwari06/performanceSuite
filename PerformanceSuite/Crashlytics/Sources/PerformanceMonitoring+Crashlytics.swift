    ///   - hangsReportingMode: Defines which hangs and how we send to Crashlytics
    ///   - storage: Simple key/value storage which we use to store some simple objects, by default `UserDefaults` is used.
    ///   - experiments: Feature flags that can be used to enable/disable some experimentation features inside PerformanceSuite. Is used for A/B testing in production.
    ///   **NB:** *Make sure that `FirebaseApp.configure() is called before calling this method! App will crash otherwise.*`
